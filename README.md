# ClarivoX

We developed this project for converting the speech to text, to help the peolpe recognize the mistakes they do while they speak.
This is based on English(US) so don't be too particular for now, As we are still developing this and trying to make it compatible with other accents including English(British) and English(India).

Tech Stack:

Used google storage firebase to store the login credentials.
Web Speech API for conversion from speech to text.

Please feel free to reach out for improvising this :)
